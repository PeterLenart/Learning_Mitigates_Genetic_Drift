# Learning_Mitigates_Genetic_Drift
This repository contains R script for a simple agent-based model that monitors allele frequencies in a population of prey, either able or not able to learn how to avoid/escape predators more effectively from the experience of unsuccessful past predator attacks. We used this script to generate results in a manuscript currently undergoing screening at BioRxiv to be published as a preprint. The link to the preprint, as well as to any other subsequent peer-reviewed publication, will put here as soon as possible.
