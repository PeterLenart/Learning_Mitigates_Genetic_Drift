This repository contains R script for an agent-based model that monitors allele frequencies in a population of prey, either able or not able to learn how to avoid/escape predators more effectively from the experience of unsuccessful past predator attacks.

Model_4.00 contains the final version of our model. This version of the model was used to generate results presented in our article published in Scientific Reports, accessible at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24748-8

Heatmaps_1.00 is the code we used to generate heatmaps in the published article (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24748-8).

Model_diploid_2.00 is an updated version of the diploid sexual version of the model. Used in the final publication (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24748-8).

Model_3.00 is an updated version of our manuscript containing new results generated by this version of the model is accessible as a preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.170258v3.

Model_2.00 contains a corrected and updated version of the original model. The file Model_diploid_1.00.R contains a script for a diploid sexual version of the model. We used these scripts to generate results that are included in the second version of our manuscript, accessible as a preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.170258v2.

The file Model_1.00 contains the initial version of the model. We used this script to generate in the original version of the preprint accessible at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.170258v1.
