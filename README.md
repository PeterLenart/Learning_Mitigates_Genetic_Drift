# Learning_Mitigates_Genetic_Drift
This repository contains R script for a simple agent-based model that monitors allele frequencies in a population of prey, either able or not able to learn how to avoid/escape predators more effectively from the experience of unsuccessful past predator attacks. We used this script to generate results in a manuscript published as a preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.170258v1.
