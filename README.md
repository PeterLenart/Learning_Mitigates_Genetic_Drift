# Learning_Mitigates_Genetic_Drift
This repository contains R script for an agent-based model that monitors allele frequencies in a population of prey, either able or not able to learn how to avoid/escape predators more effectively from the experience of unsuccessful past predator attacks. 

The file Model_2.00 contains a corrected and updated version of the original model. 
The file Model_1.00 contains a script for a diploid sexual version of the model. 
We used these scripts to generate results that are included in an updated version of the preprint, currently undergoing screening at BioRxiv. 

The file Model_1.00 contains the initial version of the model. We used this script to generate in the original version of the preprint accessible at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.24.170258v1.
